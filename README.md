# Math Speed Challenge

The **Math Speed Challenge** is a Python-based application designed to help users improve their speed and accuracy in basic arithmetic calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The game presents random math problems and challenges users to solve as many as they can within a limited time frame.

## Features

- **Time Limit**: Users are given 30 seconds to solve as many problems as possible.
- **Score Tracking**: The score is updated in real-time and displayed based on the number of correct answers.
- **Input and Feedback**: Users enter their answers, and immediate feedback is provided for each solution.
- **Countdown Timer**: A countdown timer displays the remaining time in the game.
